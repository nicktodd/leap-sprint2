# Module 07 Lab — Discussion Answers (Instructor Reference)

## Declarative vs imperative, for this file

This file is declarative: it states the desired end state (one S3 bucket, versioned, with
public access blocked) and leaves Terraform to work out how to get there, including checking
what already exists and only changing what's different. An imperative equivalent, a script of
`aws s3api create-bucket`, `aws s3api put-bucket-versioning`, and so on, would have to handle
its own error checking (does the bucket already exist? did the last command actually succeed?),
its own idempotency (running it twice shouldn't fail or duplicate anything), and its own
ordering logic. Terraform handles all of that for you, that's the main practical benefit of
declarative tools.

## Connecting to CI/CD (plan vs apply)

`terraform plan` shows exactly what would change, without changing anything, a diff for
infrastructure, similar in spirit to `git diff` before a commit. `terraform apply` actually
makes the change. Teams often gate `apply` behind a human approval specifically because
infrastructure changes can be destructive in ways application deploys usually aren't, deleting
a database, changing network access rules, or removing a security control can have
consequences that are hard or impossible to roll back, unlike redeploying a previous
application version. A routine app deploy is usually safely reversible; a `terraform apply`
sometimes isn't, that asymmetry is why extra caution is common at that specific step.

## What to check as an instructor

- Annotations are in the delegate's own words, not GenAI's explanation copy-pasted unchanged.
- At least one annotation correctly identifies the security intent of
  `aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block`, not just what it technically does.
- The declarative-vs-imperative answer is specific to *this file*, not a generic definition
  copied from a textbook.
- The plan/apply answer correctly identifies irreversibility/blast-radius as the reason for
  extra caution, not just "because it's infrastructure."
